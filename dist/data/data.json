The length of the image represents the number of minutes in the film.</p>\n<p>A 24-colour Adobe swatch file in ASE format and a hex RGB colour file are available to download for each spotmap.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src='https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4366/35888008014_d2941d2375.jpg' alt='Black Hole spotmap 532x800'></p>\n<p>More images can be found <a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/urbanwhaleshark/albums/72157649963155584/with/17126036787/'>here on Flickr</a>.</p>\n<p>There are also a couple of online articles about the spotmaps website on <a href='http://www.fastcodesign.com/1671572/infographic-the-colors-from-your-favorite-movies-mapped-to-7200-pixels'>FastCoDesign</a>, and <a href='http://gizmodo.com/5972740/the-color-of-movies-visualized'>Gizmodo</a>.</p>"
